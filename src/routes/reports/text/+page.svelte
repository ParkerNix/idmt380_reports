<h1>Grammarly, LogicBalls, and Text Generation</h1>
<div class="section">
	<div class="section-card">
		<h2>Research Goal</h2>
		<p>
			In this report, I will be examining two A.I. text content generators (Grammarly A.I. and
			LogicBalls' A.I. Content and Copy Generator) to see which is best at creating multi-paragraph
			text content. In today's world, taking alll the other parts of web design and development into
			account, the concept of content creation can be a bit of a hassle and can lead teams to
			putting information on their sites that may not have had the same work put into it as compared
			to things like colors, flows, etc. With A.I., we now have the option to create text content
			pretty reliably and quickly. To that point, this study seeks to find how these two A.I.
			compare to each other and if either one is better than the other
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section-card">
		<h2>Tool Researched</h2>
		<p>
			The A.I. I targeted for this task was Grammarly's A.I. generator and LogicBalls' A.I. Content
			and Copy Generator. Grammarly's A.I. can be activated right from their web extension, so I
			chose to use it with a Google Doc file. Meanwhile, Logicballs has its own web app for it's
			A.I., so it's a bit more inconvenient.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section-card">
		<h2>Implementation and Testing</h2>
		<p>To examine both A.I., I followed these steps per test:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Input a prompt</strong> and change the settings of the tone and formality where appropriate
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Allow the A.I. to write</strong> a multi-paragraph description
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Examine the passage</strong> to see how well it expanded the prompt and adhered to the
				tone and formality
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

			The following section will cover each test i did for the two A.I., as well as my thoughts on

									<li>REALLY long</li>

										The use of the word “Exclusively” might be a bit strong, it's built around

									</li>
									<li>
										Seems like the formal tone just tries to put bigger words in wherever it sees an

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			Both are at about the same quality at creating text, and there aren't any grammatical or
			spelling errors in the text. However, I did feel as though Grammarly specifically, but also
			LogicBalls, had issues trying to match the tone and/or formality of the prompt. In addition,
			LogicBalls can be quite long-winded, especially when asking for a more formal prompt. If i
			were to use either, I would probably go for Grammarly in general. They gave a much better
			length and I felt like it was a better starting point. LogicBalls and Grammarly both have paid
			features as well, so an interesting next step for this would be to see what happens with a
			paid plan.
