<h1>Youtube, Tiktok, and A.I. Transcription</h1>
<div class="section">
	<div class="section-card">
		<h2>Research Goal</h2>
		<p>
			In this report, I will be examining how well A.I. can transcribe spoken words in videos
			released by content creators. Making captions for videos used to be a big issue for content
			creators, who would rely on other people (oftentimes fans) to create them. Nowadays, A.I. can
			generate captions for you. That being said, I want to see if they can accurately understand
			and transcribe dialogue using various different content creators.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section-card">
		<h2>Tool Researched</h2>
		<p>
			The A.I. I targeted for this task was Youtube's and Tiktok's transcribing A.I. These are two
			of the most popular places to find content on the internet, and both have these captions
			generated in an attempt to ensure all media on their site is accessible. This allows me to
			easily find the same video on both platforms, as content creators commonly post videos to
			both.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section-card">
		<h2>Implementation and Testing</h2>
		<p>To examine both A.I., I followed these steps per test:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Find a content creator's video</strong> on both Tiktok and Youtube.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Watch the video</strong> with the captions on.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Note the number of times mistakes are made</strong> in the captions along with what issues
				the A.I. had.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Repeat for four videos,</strong> then find the average for each service
			</li>
		</ol>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Tiktok:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Better than the CalebCity video, but still a few issues</li>
							<li>
								Seems like cutting words off when editing can cause the A.I. to mess up, ass seen
								when it mistranslates "They" as "You"
							</li>
							<li><strong>Total Issue count: 4</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Youtube:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Fully correct</li>
							<li>
								Only issue was a noticeable lag in the subtitles behind the video, but it wasn't
								detrimental

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Tiktok:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								This was the worst of the videos, constantly missing names which takes away context
								for the video
							</li>
							<li>
								The audio in this video is louder. It is possible that the extra noise might be
								throwing the transcription A.I. off
							</li>
							<li><strong>Total Issue count: 7</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Youtube:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Also the worst of the videos for Youtube, with even more mistranslations and even
								some words being completely missed
							</li>
							<li>
								The lag in the words also makes the video hard to follow, as the ends of sentences
								will leave off in a weird spot only for the actual last word in the sentence to
								appear a few seconds later

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Tiktok:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Being that this is an A.I voiceover, it seems much less mistakes were made despite
								the video being quite a bit longer
							</li>
							<li>
								While the text is what is being said, there are grammatical issues that can make it
								a little hard to read, such as words not having a space between them and words being
								seemingly randomly capitalized
							</li>
							<li><strong>Total Issue count: 0, 6 with grammar issues</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Youtube:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Youtube was also able to handle the A.I. voiceover much better than the human
								voiceovers
							</li>
							<li>
								More capitalization issues appeared, along with a couple of incorrect transcriptions
							</li>
							<li><strong>Total Issue count: 2, 7 with grammar issues</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

		<p>The final averages for each platform are as follows:</p>
		<ul>

				<strong>Tiktok:</strong>

					<li><strong>Without grammar issues: 4.75</strong></li>
					<li><strong>With grammar issues: 6.25</strong></li>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			In the end, Both A.I. transcribers are about equally matched in terms of the amount of errors
			they make. However, I would say that the issues Youtube has with captions tend to be of a more
			severe magnitude than that of Tiktok. The delays that Youtube had cause certain sentences to
			be hard to follow. Both, however, could use training in slang and different speech styles.
			This is certainly an issue that has come up time and again about how A.I. is trained, and it
			seems like here it is not trained to work with CalebCity or Lenarr Young, both black content
			creators. However, more content creators would need to be researched to reach a better
			conclusion on that. Finally, it seems like these A.I. are fine with transcribing A.I.
			voiceovers. While this isn't terribly surprising, it does show that it recognizes the speech
			style those A.I. use.
