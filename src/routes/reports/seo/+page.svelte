	<div class="section-card">
		<h2>Research Goal</h2>
		<p>
			In this report, I seek to answer the question; "Can ChatGPT help a developer who is
			inexperienced with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) learn the basics and improve their website
			with general tips for and examples of good SEO?""
		</p>
		<p>
			To start, my hypothesis was that ChatGPT would be able to provide general tips that are
			accurate and would be able to provide examples of websites with good SEO, but would struggle
			to give me a good explanation of how to improve my site. Overall, I expected a score of around
			12/13.

	<div class="section-card">
		<h2>Tool Researched</h2>
		<p>
			I used my personal portfolio website (parkerishere.com) to ask ChatGPT 3.5 about it's SEO. I
			have been using ChatGPT more and more since the start of this class, so I'd like to see if it
			can help me learn more about SEO as it is one side of development that I'm still not terribly
			familiar with.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section-card">
		<h2>Implementation and Testing</h2>
		<p>To examine ChatGPT's ability to help me learn about SEO:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Ask ChatGPT 3.5 for 5 general tips about SEO.</strong> Compare these tips to the
				guidelines on
				<a href="https://developers.google.com/search" target="_blank">Google's Search Central</a> and
				determine if it matches or not. 5 points possible for the comparison, one for each tip. DO NOT
				RESET THE CHAT. (5 points)
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>
					Ask ChatGPT 3.5 for 3 example websites that have good SEO and for it to explain why they
					are good examples of the tips it gave in the first step.
				</strong>
				Compare the examples to see if they match with the tips. 3 points possible for the
				comparison of the examples, plus an extra 1 point if it can give extra tips that were not
				given at first but match the
				<a href="https://developers.google.com/search" target="_blank">Google Search Central</a>. DO
				NOT RESET THE CHAT. (3 points + 1 extra point)
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>
					Give ChatGPT 3.5 a link to my portfolio and ask it to evaluate where the site can do
					better in terms of SEO, being as specific as possible.
				</strong>
				Compare these points to the tips given before and determine if there is a match between the
				tips and the advice for the site. 3 points possible for the comparison (1 if 33% of the
				advice matches, 2 if 66% matches, and 3 if at least 90% matches, there is a max of 1 point
				if there is only one piece of advice is given), 2 points possible if it can give me specific
				advice about where on the page I can improve, and 1 extra point if it can give extra tips
				that were not given at first but match the
				<a href="https://developers.google.com/search" target="_blank">Google Search Central</a>. (5
				points + 1 extra point)
			</li>
			<li>Total up all points and find the score it receives out of 13 (15 points possible).</li>

					Of course! Improving the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of a website involves various
					strategies and techniques. Here are five tips to help you get started:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Quality Content Creation: Content is king in the world of SEO. Create high-quality,
						relevant, and engaging content that adds value to your audience. Ensure your content is
						well-written, informative, and addresses the needs and interests of your target
						audience. Use keywords strategically within your content to improve its visibility to
						search engines.
					</li>
					<li>
						Optimize On-Page Elements: Optimize on-page elements such as title tags, meta
						descriptions, headings, and URL structures. These elements provide search engines with
						important information about your website's content. Include relevant keywords in these
						elements, but avoid keyword stuffing, as it can negatively impact your SEO efforts.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mobile Optimization: With the increasing use of mobile devices, optimizing your website
						for mobile is essential for SEO. Ensure your website is mobile-friendly and offers a
						seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes. Google prioritizes
						mobile-friendly websites in its search results, so mobile optimization can significantly
						impact your SEO rankings.
					</li>
					<li>
						Quality Backlinks: Building high-quality backlinks from reputable and relevant websites
						can improve your website's authority and search engine rankings. Focus on earning
						backlinks from authoritative websites within your industry or niche. You can achieve
						this through guest blogging, creating shareable content, participating in online
						communities, and reaching out to influencers or industry leaders for collaboration
						opportunities.
					</li>
					<li>
						Regular Monitoring and Analysis: SEO is an ongoing process, and it's essential to
						monitor your website's performance regularly and analyze the effectiveness of your SEO
						efforts. Use tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to track your
						website's traffic, keyword rankings, and other relevant metrics. Based on your analysis,
						make necessary adjustments to your SEO strategy to improve your website's visibility and
						rankings in search engine results.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Implementing these tips can help you improve the SEO of your website and increase its
					visibility to potential visitors and customers. Remember that SEO is a long-term
					investment, and results may take time to manifest, so patience and consistency are key.

			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Output:</strong>
				<p>
					Sure! Let's take a look at https://parkerishere.com/ and identify some areas for potential
					SEO improvement:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Title Tag Optimization:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Current Situation: The title tag of the homepage appears to be "Parker's Portfolio"
							which is concise but lacks keywords.
						</li>
						<li>
							Suggestion: Incorporate relevant keywords related to the content of the website, such
							as "Parker's Design Portfolio | Graphic Design, Web Design, Illustrations".
						</li>
						<li>

							the page and improves its visibility in search results.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Meta Description:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Current Situation: There doesn't seem to be a meta description provided for the
							homepage.
						</li>
						<li>
							Suggestion: Write a compelling meta description that accurately summarizes the content
							of the website and includes relevant keywords.
						</li>
						<li>
							How it Helps: A well-crafted meta description can entice users to click on the link
							when it appears in search results, improving click-through rates and ultimately
							driving more traffic to the website.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Header Tags:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Current Situation: The homepage may benefit from using header tags (H1, H2, etc.) to
							structure the content.
						</li>
						<li>
							Suggestion: Use H1 tags for the main heading of the page, and H2 tags for subheadings
							to organize the content.

						<li>
							How it Helps: Alt attributes not only improve accessibility for visually impaired
							users but also provide additional context to search engines, helping them understand
							the content of the images and potentially improving image search rankings.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Content Quality and Freshness:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Current Situation: The website appears to showcase Parker's design portfolio, but it's
							essential to ensure the content is regularly updated and expanded to keep it fresh.
						</li>
						<li>
							Suggestion: Regularly add new projects, case studies, or blog posts related to design
							trends, techniques, or industry insights.
						</li>
						<li>
							How it Helps: Fresh and relevant content signals to search engines that the website is
							active and authoritative in its niche, potentially improving its rankings in search
							results.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Mobile Optimization</li>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Current Situation: It's important to ensure that the website is fully optimized for
							mobile devices.
						</li>
						<li>
							Suggestion: Use responsive design techniques to ensure that the website looks and
							functions well on smartphones and tablets.

							mobile optimization can significantly impact SEO rankings and user experience.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</ol>

					By implementing these SEO improvements, you can enhance the visibility and performance of
					the website in search engine results, ultimately driving more traffic and engagement.

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			I found ChatGPT to be pretty helpful in learning about SEO and how I can improve my site's
			SEO. It's ability to make suggestions based off of my portfolio site was much better than I
			was expecting and it gave me very specific issues and how I could resolve each. I do plan to
			implement the advice it gave me, and I would ask it again for other projects if SEO was
			important to them. It was also able to provide me with great examples and explanations that
			coincided with Google's SEO guidelines, which tells me that it is very capable of informing a
			developer about it.
